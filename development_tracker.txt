Agile Requirements
  1. As a developer, I want the framework to deal with factory instantiation
  2. As a GUI developer, I want not to have to know all of a widgets properties
  3. As a GUI developer, I want to have quick ways to implement binds and callbacks
  4. As a Mobile Developer, I want a clear GUI Thread 
  5. As a developer, I want to complications with the event system
  6. As a developer, I want want simple deletion system
  7. As a developer, I want to create widgets without complications
  8. As a System Developer, I want to be able to widgets out of existing tools
  9. As a serialization tool, I want all data to be representable without pointers
  10. As a Game developer, I want to allow external events
  11. As a Game developer, I want easy integration to SDL3 games, no boilerplate
  12. As an LLM, I want clear separation between Declarative UI and function implementation
